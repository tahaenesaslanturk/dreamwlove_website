## Website
[Go to website](https://tahaenes.com/dreamwlove_website/#/)

This is a mobile and web app you can write your dreams as well as dreams' details and prices, or enter your all transactions (as income or expense) to see your current money. Also, you can categorize your dreams and check your dreams when they become real.

This is the first app I have ever made all of backend and frontend myself. I have used flutter for frontend and django for backend. All project was done in 13 hours.

__NOTE:__ You cannot enter the website because I did not put registration page to the website. Instead you can see the details of the project in the videos below.
